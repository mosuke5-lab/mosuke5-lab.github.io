      <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mosuke.tech/entry/2021/03/11/kubernetes-node-down/&#34;&gt;Original Japanese text&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is mosuke.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Today, I would like to confirm the behavior of pods when a node failure occurs in Kubernetes.&#xA;Until now, I had an incorrect understanding of pod behavior and scheduling in the event of node failure.&#xA;I am ashamed to admit it, but I would like to explain what I have confirmed for those who have the same misconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
